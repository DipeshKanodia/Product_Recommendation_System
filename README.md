# Product_Recommendation_System

This is a product recommendation system that provides personalized product recommendations to users based on their preferences and behavior. The system initially utilizes popularity and product similarity to make recommendations and later refines these recommendations using personalized user data.

## Features
- Popularity-Based Recommendations: The system starts by recommending popular products that are commonly liked by a broad range of users.

- Product Similarity: The system also considers product similarity. If a user has shown interest in a particular product, the system recommends similar products based on product attributes.

- Personalization: As users interact with the system and provide feedback, their preferences and behavior are used to refine recommendations. The system learns from user data to make more personalized suggestions over time.
